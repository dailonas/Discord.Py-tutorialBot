# Discord.Py Bot Tutorial 
### Description

> This is a bot source code based on the discord.py library!
The code highlights the constant development of a tutorial bot to better learn discord.py
with comments for each line of code so that we can find our way easily! The code is suitable
for all levels and aimed at beginners in programming with my friend "python" who wish to create
a discord bot or become familiar with discord.py.

### Remark
- Comments are only in French
- The code is gradually developed
- the code is made as part of an apprenticeship and not professional
- Knowledge of the basics of python is mandatory for a better understanding of the code

### Prerequisite

> Have installed the discord.py library
```py
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py : You can get the library directly from PyPI
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py : If you use Windows, use this instead
# You can check the discord.py documentation to learn more .
```
> have the basics in python
```txt
Knowledge of certain notions of programming with Python is mandatory for a better understanding of the code.
```
> Have created a bot via the discord developer portal
```py
You must create a bot via the discord developer portal and activate all intents. You will need its token but also its presence on a server to carry out your tests.
